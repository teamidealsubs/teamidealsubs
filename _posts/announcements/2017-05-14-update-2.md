<p>Things have been a little quiet on our part lately due to our translators being busy, but we finished subbing the <strong>Well Done Again Today</strong> episode featuring Yoojung where she visits a sick mom whose daughter happens to be a big Yoojung fan. Head on over to <a href="/ioi/welldoneagaintoday">this page</a> to watch it!</p> Big thank you to musicgal and Calynxx for the fast work!
<p>Also a quick update regarding Gugudan's 'Kiss The Radio'. We were busy working on this but the sole translator was caught up with real life work, so unfortunately we didn't finish it fast enough. It has been subbed by "an3jeong" in the meantime, so feel free to watch his subs on Youtube.</p>

<p>Enjoy the video and stay tuned for more!</p>
