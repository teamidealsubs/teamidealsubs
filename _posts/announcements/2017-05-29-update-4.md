<p>There has been quite a lot of confusion around this episode. Basically they skipped subbing this episode for some reason and nobody is really sure why. Last week a supposedly subbed Episode 6 released from the official source, but again there has been confusion around this.</p>

<p>It wasn't actually Episode 6, but they uploaded Episode 7 and titled it Episode 6. The episode was called "Good-bye LA", which is the title of the bonus Episode 7. "Shall We Dance?" is the title for Episode 6. It's unfortunate things got so messy, but here it is at last: the real English subbed DDL Episode 6! You can watch it <a href="/ioi/ddl6">here</a>.</p>
