Hello everyone,

Just a quick status update about the Time Slip concert. We haven't forgotten about it, but we're in the process of shifting the previous timed material. I started working on it a while ago, but after that a second version came out without the hardsubbed Chinese subs. Obviously it would be better for the viewers to use the version without the hardsubs, so hopefully we can use the already timed subs from the previous video to make up for it.
