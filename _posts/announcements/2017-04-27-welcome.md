Hello everyone,

We decided to try things a little different this time because we keep running into problems on other platforms. People keep reporting our videos or they get taken down automatically by YouTube/Dailymotion/Facebook and it's quite frustrating, not only for ourselves, but for our viewers too. We just want people to have a place where they can watch our subbed vids without both of us having to worry that it will get taken down at any moment.

We're truly sorry if we caused any inconvenience for uploading our videos on different platforms all the time, but hopefully this will be a good solution. I think it's really unfortunate that we have to leave YouTube behind for the time being because of the amount of copyright strikes we have amassed, because it brings a smile to my face to see all the people comment on our videos. That's why we implemented a comment system on this site aswell. I understand it's a bit of a bother to register for yet another thing, but we would enjoy it if people interacted with us and with each other on this site, too!

That will be it for now, enjoy our videos and look forward to our next ones!

Also special thanks to Sekl for helping out with the site a lot, it wouldn't have been possible without him.
